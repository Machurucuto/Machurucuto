- 👋 Hi, I’m @Machurucuto
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Python language, data Science.
- 🌱 I am currently learning Python since March 2021, I have done virtual courses on my own, I have done some projects related to my daily work, such as the behavior of daily and monthly household expenses, behavior of water consumption, time series of the rate of official change (www.bcv.org.ve) and other programs.
- 💞️ I seek to collaborate in data science when I have a better knowledge of the language and thus be able to support the projects where I participate....
- 📫 How to reach me ...
